The app I developed was a weight tracking application. It is designed to authenticate user login and provide a standard weight tracking application experience. It allows for user to input hteir weight and keep track of the goals that they set for themselves.
Login and weight tracking screens were the basis of this application. There is not that much to the application other as far as needing many menus and screens to accomodate a lot of features.
Coding my application was extremely difficult and I used help from a friend to develop it. I spent a lot of time researching how to code and implement different features within the app.
I struggled along the entire development process and the help from a friend is what kept me on the right track and helped me get through the frustrating parts.
I wouldn't say i was particularly successful in any aspect as it required me to research a lot to come up with the created app.
